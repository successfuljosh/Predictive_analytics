# **Predictive Analysis Using LSTM**
The long short term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture
Unlike traditional feed-forward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can handle single data points (such as pictures) as well as full data sequences (such as speech or video).
